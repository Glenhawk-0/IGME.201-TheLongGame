# IGME.201-TheLongGame
IGME.201 | week 10-11 | Homework

Open ended objectives to accomplish using all the knowledge and skills you have gained so far in this course:

* When the program starts, ask the user to enter their name.
* By default, the player starts with a score of 0.
* Add 1 point to their score for every keypress they make.
* Display the player’s updated score after each keypress.
* When the player presses the Enter key, end the game.
  Hint: the following code reads a keypress and checks whether it was the Enter key: Console.ReadKey().Key == ConsoleKey.Enter
* When the player presses Enter, save their score in a file.
  Hint: Consider saving this to a file named [username].txt. For this challenge, you can assume the user doesn’t enter a name     that would produce an illegal file name (such as *).
* When a user enters a name at the start, if they already have a previously saved score, start with that score instead.

Good Luck :)
